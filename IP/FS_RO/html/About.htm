      <b>SEGGER Microcontroller</b> develops and distributes hardware and software development tools as well as software components for embedded systems. 
      An "embedded system" is one in which a microprocessor and associated components are incorporated into a device helping to accomplish difficult and 
      complex tasks in products such as cell phones, medical instruments, instrument clusters, measurement instruments, satellite radios, digital cameras etc.</p>

      <p>SEGGER was founded in 1997, is privately held, has been profitable since its inception, and is growing steadily. 
      Based in Hilden with distributors in all continents and a local office in Massachusetts, SEGGER offers its full product range worldwide.
      SEGGER software products include: embOS (RTOS), emWin (GUI), emFile (File System), emUSB (USB host and device stack) and emNet (TCP/IP stack). 
      With the experience in programming efficiently on embedded systems, SEGGER created highly integrated, cost-effective programming and development tools, 
      such as the Flasher (stand-alone flash programmer) and the industry leading J-Link/J-Trace emulator.</p>

      <p>SEGGER’s intention is to cut software development time for embedded applications by offering affordable, high quality, flexible and easy-to-use tools 
      and software components allowing developers to focus on their applications.</p>
